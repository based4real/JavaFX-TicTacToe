# JavaFX-TicTacToe
Second project on the 1. semester of Computer Science. We had 1 week to finish this project, I worked together with 2 others in making this project. We had to use JavaFX for rendering. 
When first receiving the project, we had a very very simple base with no logic besides a few windows that could open and an Interface.
One rule was that we couldn't change the "IGameModel" interface at all.

## Features

- TicTacToe game mechanics.
- Two game modes: Player vs. Player and Player vs. Ai.
- Settings system.
- Effects when hovering over tile.
- JavaFX (FXML) layout.
- Material dark themed CSS.

## Additional

We started this project a monday, and finished friday. That includes writing the code for the Game, making a "report" of the project + an UML diagram of the project.

If we had more time, we would have refactored the code and cleaned it up. Some things are mentioned multiple times.
