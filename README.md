# JavaFX-TicTacToe
Second project on the 1. semester of Computer Science. We had 1 week to finish this project, I worked together with 2 others in making this project. We had to use JavaFX to draw. 
When first receiving the project, we had a very very simple base with no logic besides a few windows that could open and an Interface.
One rule was that we couldn't change the "IGameModel" interface at all.

# Project
We started this project a monday, and finished friday. That includes writing the code for the Game, making a "report" of the project + an UML diagram of the project.

# Stuff to be improved
I myself wrote the entire AIHandler, and the way to count horizontal, vertical etc. wasn't the greatest at all and could definitely need improving. (Please note that this was one of my first ever projects in IntelliJ and using JavaFX)
The PlayerHandler class could be improved too.
